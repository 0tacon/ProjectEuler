ProjectEuler
============

Hi All,

Another small, fun project I'm working on in my spare time.
This time it's the popular coding/mathematics challenge: Project Euler.
So far I've only done the first few easy problems, but will continue to work on the rest when I have a chance.
I could see the ones using large prime numbers becoming quite tricky!

Regards,
Daniel
